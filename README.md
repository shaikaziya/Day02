1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?
   Ans:-  HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
   HTTP/1.1=========>HTTP is a top level application protocol that exchanges information between client and server.In this process,client sends a "text-based" request to a                      server by calling a method like GET or POST.In response,server sends a resource like an HTML page back to client.
   HTTP/2===========>HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as                        compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
   
2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
    Ans:-   Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These               keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
            By using keys we can get the values of that particular key.
            ex:-   const student={"name":"Aziya","RollNo":01,"address":"Hyderabad"}
                   console.log(student.name) or 
                   console.log(student["name"]) =======>By this we get name of that student.
